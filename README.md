## 🔍 The Method Behind the Magic
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

  - **Discovery:** Fresh recruits with _under 2 years_ witness the highest attrition, validating our hypothesis.

- 2.	**Gender Dynamics:**
  - **Revelation:** Attrition isn't gender-neutral; more males (136) exit compared to females (76), debunking the hypothesis.
